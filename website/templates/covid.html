              <h4>Keeping You Safe</h4>
              <p>Every piece of equipment used during training sessions is fully sanitized.
                This is above and beyond any standard of a brick-and-mortar gym as their high volume practically
                restricts their ability to protect their customers to this degree. I take pride in my ability to protect
                my clients and minimize the risk of COVID-19 by using antiseptics including, but not limited to, isopropyl
                alcohol, bleach, and Clorox commercial disinfecting wipes.
